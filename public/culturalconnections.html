  <h4>The top two cultural shock i had when i moved to Canada </h4>      
 <LI> I won't lie! initially, it was the drivers and the pedestrians,
    so whenever I'm trying to cross over the road even when it's a regular street and a car can see me coming they do wait for me to pass before they proceed with driving but back home in Nigeria it's not that you pedestrians are the one that has to wait for the vehicle to proceed and you have to make sure the road is very clear of cars before you cross to avoid getting by a vehicle because if you got hit the driving might not even wait to check if you are good and before you cross the main-roads you have to be swift and you might have to make a gesture by waving your hand directly to any vehicle towards you. So, it was pretty shocking to me when
     I got here and found out that the drivers are the ones who have to wait to cross. </LI>

    The people over here are so kind and friendly, They are always willing to help because
 when I got here I didn't know how things worked and I was trying to get to Metrotown when all the money I had on me was cash and I don't see how TransLink cards work yet. So, when I got to the bus stop I asked a guy there he told me what to do and I responded by telling him I had no coins on me all I had was US dollars and not even Canadian Dollars and he gave me some coins to get on the Bus.
<br>
 -My second experience over here is that I got lost on my way back home and it was freezing, I asked a man to book me a ride on his phone that I would pay the cab driver cash when I got home and unfortunately, he said he doesn't have Cab app and he offered to drive me home in his car instead, I never believed it, he took me home 
 people over here in Canada are so kind!!!
